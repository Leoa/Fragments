This directory contains example code for G. Blake Meike's talk on Android Honeycomb Fragments.

To use the projects with eclipse, copy the files $p/tools/ide/eclipse/{classpath,project} to
$p/.{classpath,project} respectively.  Since it was set up for my system, you may have to
do some tweaking to get it to work.

If you have any questions or problems, leave me a note at GitHub.
